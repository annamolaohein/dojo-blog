The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distrubution o letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and aweb page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'Lorem Ipsum' will uncover many websites still in their infancy. Various versions have evoled over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like). \n\n\nWhere does it come from?\nContrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard MCLintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydeny College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, form a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undobtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.1032 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The EXtrems of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45B. This book is a treatise on the thery of ethics, section 1.1032. \n\nThe standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Section 1.1032 and 1.1033 from \"de Finbus Bonorum et Malorum\" by Cicero and also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H.Rackham. \n\nWhere can I get some?\nThere are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need t obe sure thee isn't anyghing embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All ther LOrem Ipsum generatotrs on the Internert trend to repeat predefined chunks as neccessary, making this the first true generator on therInternet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combinesd with a handful of model sentence structures, to geneate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.",
